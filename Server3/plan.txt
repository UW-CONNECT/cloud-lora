1) update file sent from client to have channel ID exposed

2) Need to boot server, have docker processes connect to server
	- they will connect and send their channel and base_station ID they want
	- this will allow the server to create a mapping of (ID, channel):(IP, Port)
	
3) Beef up consumer so they are constantly receiving (mini version of current impl)
	
4) after this, attempt to send data in the reverse direction
	- start by booting, then connecting dummy client
	- have a separate thread that waits for incoming connectsion (port 65432)
	- when incoming packet received, route to docker process (using mapping table)
	
	
PLAN2:

interface is just decompressed active periods
also define ports for each channel and channel combination
on the localhost send all of the decompressed packets to consumers

the consumers do the work then. Each message sent is the size, ID, Chan, time, data
This means interface is just metadata and IQ samples. User can do what they want, just open a socket
